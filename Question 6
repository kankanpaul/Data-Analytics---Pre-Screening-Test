            product_id,

1)In the subquery (product_id, warehouse_id, date) IN (SELECT product_id,warehouse_id,MAX(date) AS latest_date FROM inventory GROUP BY product_id, warehouse_id), 
we're finding the latest date for each combination of product_id and warehouse_id using the MAX(date) function and grouping by those columns.

2)The subquery's result is then used to filter the main query's result. We retrieve the product_id, warehouse_id, 
and total_quantity by summing the quantity for each product and warehouse on the latest date available.

3)The GROUP BY clause groups the result by product_id and warehouse_id, 
ensuring that we calculate the total quantity for each product in each warehouse.
