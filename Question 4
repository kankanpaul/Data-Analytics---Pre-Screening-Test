SELECT
    activity_date,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN activity_type IS NOT NULL THEN user_id END) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100, 2) AS engagement_rate
FROM
    user_activity
GROUP BY
    activity_date;




Explanation of the query:

1)We start by selecting the activity_date column in the result.

2)Inside the ROUND function, we calculate the engagement rate using the following formula:
(Number of users with activity / Total number of distinct users) * 100

3)We use the COUNT(DISTINCT CASE ... END) to count the number of distinct users who performed at least one activity on each day. The CASE statement checks if the activity_type is not null.

4)We divide this count by the COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) to get the total number of distinct users on that day.

5)We multiply the result by 100 to convert it to a percentage.

6)The GROUP BY activity_date groups the results by each day.
